## TODOs

//https://github.com/grillp/ha-custom-card-rollup-ts-lit-starter/tree/main looks really good

- "00" in countdown - grey it out 
- add the time to the train station configuraiton options.
2. docs - update this readme
3. Easier HA install process
4. Add configuration options: pick train stations, set regular and fast time to get to the station.
